<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project was started to learn more about Godot Engine and to create a simple game. 
The game is a prototype and is open for anyone who wants to learn more about Godot Engine. 
It is a simple action game where the player must survive the most they can, and gets
some inspiration from the game "Vampire Survivors".

The code is open for anyone who wants to learn more of Godot. 
You also may create your own game respecting the Mozilla licence set up for this project.
